## 🧠 Approach I Follow

For every problem:

1. Understand the problem clearly  
2. Break it into smaller logical steps  
3. Write a simple working solution  
4. Improve readability and optimization  
5. Add comments where necessary  

My goal is not just to solve the problem — but to solve it cleanly.
